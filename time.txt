19-9-2020 : 
1h : think about models and controllers and create them 
	10min					50 min
not so sure this is the way to go.

20-9-2020:
5h : 
- create the auth system
- routes
- create the main homePage with student modal 
- solve problems with npm and write the "some comands.txt file"
ready to think how to get data and show it, then redecorate the frontend agian 

21-9-2020:
8.5h:
- work on backend
	-select data from database 
	-update data in database
-update modal with DB data using jquery
-try use blade to update modal's data insted of jquery (but did not work)

22-9-2020:
2h: try to make modal call the update function in the controllers
PS: in the toturial they use store dunction for both update and create to avoid 
sending the id to form url with jquery
solution: control form action with jquery to add user id to it 
52 min:
make delete button work and add user in the home.blade.php
spend good time on making div collapse (it was ez to make it disapear and appear without collapse)
20 min:
problem: jquery does not show studnetname or student_id in modal 
solution: after adding (add user div) in the (home.blade.php) there were doubled ids so jquery changed the first element with id
18 min :
add button functionality (users added but without UsingRecord and userRecord)
form with method "POST" does not POST if did not use hidden input!
25 min : 
work on Eloquent events to create rows in usingRecord and userRecord when AppUser is added automatically
20 min:
make sure Add user,Delete user,update user  buttons is working with showing user data if exists and 
"no user data" in case of no data available
